Note that <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-services.html"">integrated services</a> allow only certificate types and keys they support to be associated with their resources. Further  their support differs depending on whether the certificate is imported into IAM or into ACM. For more information  see the documentation for each service. For more information about importing certificates into ACM  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate.html"">Importing Certificates</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Certificate Manager User Guide</i>. </p> <note> <p>ACM does not provide <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-renewal.html"">managed renewal</a> for certificates that you import.</p> </note> <p>Note the following guidelines when importing third party certificates:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing.</p> </li> <li> <p>The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a passphrase.</p> </li> <li> <p>The private key must be no larger than 5 KB (5 120 bytes).</p> </li> <li> <p>If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed  you must enter its certificate chain.</p> </li> <li> <p>If a certificate chain is included  the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the chain.</p> </li> <li> <p>The certificate  private key  and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded.</p> </li> <li> <p>The current time must be between the <code>Not Before</code> and <code>Not After</code> certificate fields.</p> </li> <li> <p>The <code>Issuer</code> field must not be empty.</p> </li> <li> <p>The OCSP authority URL  if present  must not exceed 1000 characters.</p> </li> <li> <p>To import a new certificate  omit the <code>CertificateArn</code> argument. Include this argument only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you import a certificate by using the CLI  you must specify the certificate  the certificate chain  and the private key by their file names preceded by <code>fileb://</code>. For example  you can specify a certificate saved in the <code>C:	emp</code> folder as <code>fileb://C:\temp\certificate_to_import.pem</code>. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request  include these arguments as BLOBs. </p> </li> <li> <p>When you import a certificate by using an SDK  you must specify the certificate  the certificate chain  and the private key files in the manner required by the programming language you're using. </p> </li> <li> <p>The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the algorithm of the signing CA. For example  if the signing CA key type is RSA  then the certificate key type must also be RSA.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This operation returns the <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html"">Amazon Resource Name (ARN)</a> of the imported certificate.</p>"""
acm,ListCertificates,"<p>Retrieves a list of certificate ARNs and domain names. You can request that only certificates that match a specific status be listed. You can also filter by specific attributes of the certificate. Default filtering returns only <code>RSA_2048</code> certificates. For more information, see <a>Filters</a>.</p>"
acm,ListTagsForCertificate,"<p>Lists the tags that have been applied to the ACM certificate. Use the certificate's Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to specify the certificate. To add a tag to an ACM certificate, use the <a>AddTagsToCertificate</a> action. To delete a tag, use the <a>RemoveTagsFromCertificate</a> action. </p>"
acm,PutAccountConfiguration,
acm,RemoveTagsFromCertificate,
acm,RenewCertificate,
acm,RequestCertificate,"<p>Requests an ACM certificate for use with other Amazon Web Services services. To request an ACM certificate, you must specify a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in the <code>DomainName</code> parameter. You can also specify additional FQDNs in the <code>SubjectAlternativeNames</code> parameter. </p> <p>If you are requesting a private certificate, domain validation is not required. If you are requesting a public certificate, each domain name that you specify must be validated to verify that you own or control the domain. You can use <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-dns.html"">DNS validation</a> or <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-validate-email.html"">email validation</a>. We recommend that you use DNS validation. ACM issues public certificates after receiving approval from the domain owner. </p> <note> <p>ACM behavior differs from the <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#appendix-B.2"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125#appendix-B.2</a>RFC 6125 specification of the certificate validation process. first checks for a subject alternative name  and  if it finds one  ignores the common name (CN)</p> </note>"""

application-autoscaling,PutScalingPolicy,"<p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for an Application Auto Scaling scalable target.</p> <p>Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID, and scalable dimension. A scaling policy applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling policy until you have registered the resource as a scalable target.</p> <p>Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same scalable target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling policies, one or more step scaling policies, or both. However, there is a chance that multiple policies could conflict, instructing the scalable target to scale out or in at the same time. Application Auto Scaling gives precedence to the policy that provides the largest capacity for both scale out and scale in. For example, if one policy increases capacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200 percent, and the current capacity is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the policy with the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to 30. </p> <p>We recommend caution, however, when using target tracking scaling policies with step scaling policies because conflicts between these policies can cause undesirable behavior. For example, if the step scaling policy initiates a scale-in activity before the target tracking policy is ready to scale in, the scale-in activity will not be blocked. After the scale-in activity completes, the target tracking policy could instruct the scalable target to scale out again. </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-target-tracking.html"">Target tracking scaling policies</a> and <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-step-scaling-policies.html"">Step scaling policies</a> in the <i>Application Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>If a scalable target is deregistered  the scalable target is no longer available to execute scaling policies.

autoscaling-plans,DeleteComputeEnvironment,"<p>Deletes an Batch compute environment.</p> <p>Before you can delete a compute environment, you must set its state to <code>DISABLED</code> with the <a>UpdateComputeEnvironment</a> API operation and disassociate it from any job queues with the <a>UpdateJobQueue</a> API operation. Compute environments that use Fargate resources must terminate all active jobs on that compute environment before deleting the compute environment. If this isn't done, the compute environment enters an invalid state.</p>"
autoscaling-plans,DeleteJobQueue,<p>Deletes the specified job queue. You must first disable submissions for a queue with the <a>UpdateJobQueue</a> operation. All jobs in the queue are eventually terminated when you delete a job queue. The jobs are terminated at a rate of about 16 jobs each second.</p> <p>It's not necessary to disassociate compute environments from a queue before submitting a <code>DeleteJobQueue</code> request.</p>
autoscaling-plans,DeregisterJobDefinition,<p>Deregisters an Batch job definition. Job definitions are permanently deleted after 180 days.</p>

They can't be overridden this way using the <code>memory</code> and <code>vcpus</code> parameters. Rather, you must specify updates to job definition parameters in a <code>ResourceRequirements</code> object that's included in the <code>containerOverrides</code> parameter.</p> <important> <p>Jobs that run on Fargate resources can't be guaranteed to run for more than 14 days. This is because, after 14 days, Fargate resources might become unavailable and job might be terminated.</p> </important>"
autoscaling-plans,TagResource,"<p>Associates the specified tags to a resource with the specified <code>resourceArn</code>.

cloudformation,CreateChangeSet,"<p>Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set shows all of the resources that CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an existing stack, CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences.

The task returned can come from any of the pipelines that match the <code>workerGroup</code> value passed in by the task runner and that was launched using the IAM user credentials specified by the task runner.</p> <p>If tasks are ready in the work queue, <code>PollForTask</code> returns a response immediately. If no tasks are available in the queue, <code>PollForTask</code> uses long-polling and holds on to a poll connection for up to a 90 seconds, during which time the first newly scheduled task is handed to the task runner. To accomodate this, set the socket timeout in your task runner to 90 seconds. The task runner should not call <code>PollForTask</code> again on the same <code>workerGroup</code> until it receives a response, and this can take up to 90 seconds. </p>"
datapipeline,PutPipelineDefinition,"<p>Adds tasks, schedules, and preconditions to the specified pipeline. You can use <code>PutPipelineDefinition</code> to populate a new pipeline.</p> <p> <code>PutPipelineDefinition</code> also validates the configuration as it adds it to the pipeline. Changes to the pipeline are saved unless one of the following three validation errors exists in the pipeline. </p> <ol> <li>An object is missing a name or identifier field.</li> <li>A string or reference field is empty.</li> <li>The number of objects in the pipeline exceeds the maximum allowed objects.</li> <li>The pipeline is in a FINISHED state.</li> </ol> <p> Pipeline object definitions are passed to the <code>PutPipelineDefinition</code> action and returned by the <a>GetPipelineDefinition</a> action. </p>"
datapipeline,QueryObjects,<p>Queries the specified pipeline for the names of objects that match the specified set of conditions.</p>
datapipeline,RemoveTags,<p>Removes existing tags from the specified pipeline.</p>
datapipeline,ReportTaskProgress,"<p>Task runners call <code>ReportTaskProgress</code> when assigned a task to acknowledge that it has the task. If the web service does not receive this acknowledgement within 2 minutes, it assigns the task in a subsequent <a>PollForTask</a> call. After this initial acknowledgement, the task runner only needs to report progress every 15 minutes to maintain its ownership of the task. You can change this reporting time from 15 minutes by specifying a <code>reportProgressTimeout</code> field in your pipeline.</p> <p>If a task runner does not report its status after 5 minutes, AWS Data Pipeline assumes that the task runner is unable to process the task and reassigns the task in a subsequent response to <a>PollForTask</a>. Task runners should call <code>ReportTaskProgress</code> every 60 seconds.</p>"
datapipeline,ReportTaskRunnerHeartbeat,"<p>Task runners call <code>ReportTaskRunnerHeartbeat</code> every 15 minutes to indicate that they are operational. If the AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner is launched on a resource managed by AWS Data Pipeline, the web service can use this call to detect when the task runner application has failed and restart a new instance.</p>"
datapipeline,SetStatus,
datapipeline,SetTaskStatus,<p>Task runners call <code>SetTaskStatus</code> to notify AWS Data Pipeline that a task is completed and provide information about the final status. A task runner makes this call regardless of whether the task was sucessful. A task runner does not need to call <code>SetTaskStatus</code> for tasks that are canceled by the web service during a call to <a>ReportTaskProgress</a>.</p>
datasync,CancelTaskExecution,"<p>Cancels execution of a task. </p> <p>When you cancel a task execution, the transfer of some files is abruptly interrupted. The contents of files that are transferred to the destination might be incomplete or inconsistent with the source files. However, if you start a new task execution on the same task and you allow the task execution to complete, file content on the destination is complete and consistent. This applies to other unexpected failures that interrupt a task execution. In all of these cases, DataSync successfully complete the transfer when you start the next task execution.</p>"
datasync,CreateAgent,"<p>Activates an DataSync agent that you have deployed on your host. The activation process associates your agent with your account. In the activation process, you specify information such as the Amazon Web Services Region that you want to activate the agent in.

Your tasks are created in this Amazon Web Services Region.</p> <p>You can activate the agent in a VPC (virtual private cloud) or provide the agent access to a VPC endpoint so you can run tasks without going over the public internet.</p> <p>You can use an agent for more than one location. If a task uses multiple agents, all of them need to have status AVAILABLE for the task to run. If you use multiple agents for a source location, the status of all the agents must be AVAILABLE for the task to run. </p> <p>Agents are automatically updated by Amazon Web Services on a regular basis, using a mechanism that ensures minimal interruption to your tasks.</p> <p/>"

directconnect,CreateInterconnect,"<p>Creates an interconnect between an Direct Connect Partner's network and a specific Direct Connect location.</p> <p>An interconnect is a connection that is capable of hosting other connections. The Direct Connect Partner can use an interconnect to provide Direct Connect hosted connections to customers through their own network services. Like a standard connection, an interconnect links the partner's network to an Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end is connected to the partner's router, the other to an Direct Connect router.</p> <p>You can automatically add the new interconnect to a link aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new interconnect is allocated on the same Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no interconnect is created.</p> <p>For each end customer, the Direct Connect Partner provisions a connection on their interconnect by calling <a>AllocateHostedConnection</a>.

directconnect,CreateLag,"<p>Creates a link aggregation group (LAG) with the specified number of bundled physical dedicated connections between the customer network and a specific Direct Connect location. A LAG is a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple interfaces, enabling you to treat them as a single interface.</p> <p>All connections in a LAG must use the same bandwidth (either 1Gbps or 10Gbps) and must terminate at the same Direct Connect endpoint.</p> <p>You can have up to 10 dedicated connections per LAG. Regardless of this limit, if you request more connections for the LAG than Direct Connect can allocate on a single endpoint, no LAG is created.</p> <p>You can specify an existing physical dedicated connection or interconnect to include in the LAG (which counts towards the total number of connections). Doing so interrupts the current physical dedicated connection, and re-establishes them as a member of the LAG. The LAG will be created on the same Direct Connect endpoint to which the dedicated connection terminates. Any virtual interfaces associated with the dedicated connection are automatically disassociated and re-associated with the LAG. The connection ID does not change.</p> <p>If the Amazon Web Services account used to create a LAG is a registered Direct Connect Partner, the LAG is automatically enabled to host sub-connections. For a LAG owned by a partner, any associated virtual interfaces cannot be directly configured.</p>"
directconnect,CreatePrivateVirtualInterface,"<p>Creates a private virtual interface. A virtual interface is the VLAN that transports Direct Connect traffic. A private virtual interface can be connected to either a Direct Connect gateway or a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW). Connecting the private virtual interface to a Direct Connect gateway enables the possibility for connecting to multiple VPCs, including VPCs in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Connecting the private virtual interface to a VGW only provides access to a single VPC within the same Region.</p> <p>Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up to 30 seconds.

Custom IPv6 addresses are not supported.</p>"
directconnect,CreateTransitVirtualInterface,"<p>Creates a transit virtual interface. A transit virtual interface should be used to access one or more transit gateways associated with Direct Connect gateways. A transit virtual interface enables the connection of multiple VPCs attached to a transit gateway to a Direct Connect gateway.</p> <important> <p>If you associate your transit gateway with one or more Direct Connect gateways, the Autonomous System Number (ASN) used by the transit gateway and the Direct Connect gateway must be different. For example, if you use the default ASN 64512 for both your the transit gateway and Direct Connect gateway, the association request fails.</p> </important> <p>Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 8500 (jumbo frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to support jumbo frames.

dynamodb,BatchWriteItem,"<p>The <code>BatchWriteItem</code> operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables.

To update items, use the <code>UpdateItem</code> action.</p> </note> <p>The individual <code>PutItem</code> and <code>DeleteItem</code> operations specified in <code>BatchWriteItem</code> are atomic; however <code>BatchWriteItem</code> as a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations are returned in the <code>UnprocessedItems</code> response parameter. You can investigate and optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call <code>BatchWriteItem</code> in a loop. Each iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new <code>BatchWriteItem</code> request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.</p> <p>If <i>none</i> of the items can be processed due to insufficient provisioned throughput on all of the tables in the request, then <code>BatchWriteItem</code> returns a <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>.</p> <important> <p>If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items.

For example  you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests  and <code>BatchWriteItem</code> does not return deleted items in the response.</p> <p>If you use a programming language that supports concurrency  you can use threads to write items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the threads. With languages that don't support threading  you must update or delete the specified items one at a time.

If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService action.</p> <p>In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html"">Service Load Balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance that they're hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.</p> <p>There are two service scheduler strategies available:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>REPLICA</code> - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default  the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html"">Service Scheduler Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DAEMON</code> - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy  you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks  a task placement strategy  or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html"">Service Scheduler Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties  such as the task definition or the desired count of a service  with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation. The default value for a replica service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 0%.</p> <p>If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller  the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment  as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer)  and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example  if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%  the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and they're reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.</p> <p>If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller  the <b>maximum percent</b> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PENDING</code> state during a deployment  as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer)  and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example  if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%  the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.</p> <p>If a service is using either the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type  the <b>minimum healthy percent</b> and <b>maximum percent</b> values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state while the container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state.

Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.</p> <p>In EventBridge  it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops  where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example  a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket  and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully  the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again  creating an infinite loop.</p> <p>To prevent this  write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example  your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state  instead of after any change. </p> <p>An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting  which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit.

firehose,CreateDeliveryStream,"<p>Creates a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.</p> <p>By default, you can create up to 50 delivery streams per AWS Region.</p> <p>This is an asynchronous operation that immediately returns. The initial status of the delivery stream is <code>CREATING</code>. After the delivery stream is created, its status is <code>ACTIVE</code> and it now accepts data. If the delivery stream creation fails, the status transitions to <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>. Attempts to send data to a delivery stream that is not in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state cause an exception. To check the state of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>.</p> <p>If the status of a delivery stream is <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, this status doesn't change, and you can't invoke <code>CreateDeliveryStream</code> again on it. However, you can invoke the <a>DeleteDeliveryStream</a> operation to delete it.</p> <p>A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be configured to receive records directly from providers using <a>PutRecord</a> or <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, or it can be configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its source. To specify a Kinesis data stream as input, set the <code>DeliveryStreamType</code> parameter to <code>KinesisStreamAsSource</code>, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and role ARN in the <code>KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration</code> parameter.</p> <p>To create a delivery stream with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled, include <a>DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput</a> in your request. This is optional. You can also invoke <a>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</a> to turn on SSE for an existing delivery stream that doesn't have SSE enabled.</p> <p>A delivery stream is configured with a single destination: Amazon S3, Amazon ES, Amazon Redshift, or Splunk. You must specify only one of the following destination configuration parameters: <code>ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration</code>, or <code>SplunkDestinationConfiguration</code>.</p> <p>When you specify <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, you can also provide the following optional values: BufferingHints, <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code>, and <code>CompressionFormat</code>. By default, if no <code>BufferingHints</code> value is provided, Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever condition is satisfied first. <code>BufferingHints</code> is a hint, so there are some cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly. For example, record boundaries might be such that the size is a little over or under the configured buffering size. By default, no encryption is performed. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3.</p> <p>A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location. Kinesis Data Firehose first delivers data to Amazon S3 and then uses <code>COPY</code> syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table. This is specified in the <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> parameter.</p> </li> <li> <p>The compression formats <code>SNAPPY</code> or <code>ZIP</code> cannot be specified in <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> because the Amazon Redshift <code>COPY</code> operation that reads from the S3 bucket doesn't support these compression formats.</p> </li> <li> <p>We strongly recommend that you use the user name and password you provide exclusively with Kinesis Data Firehose, and that the permissions for the account are restricted for Amazon Redshift <code>INSERT</code> permissions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Kinesis Data Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of the destination. The role should allow the Kinesis Data Firehose principal to assume the role, and the role should have permissions that allow the service to deliver the data. For more information, see <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3"">Grant Kinesis Data Firehose Access to an Amazon S3 Destination</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide</i>.</p>"""
firehose,DeleteDeliveryStream,"<p>Deletes a delivery stream and its data.</p> <p>To check the state of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>. You can delete a delivery stream only if it is in one of the following states: <code>ACTIVE</code>, <code>DELETING</code>, <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, or <code>DELETING_FAILED</code>. You can't delete a delivery stream that is in the <code>CREATING</code> state. While the deletion request is in process, the delivery stream is in the <code>DELETING</code> state.</p> <p>While the delivery stream is in the <code>DELETING</code> state, the service might continue to accept records, but it doesn't make any guarantees with respect to delivering the data. Therefore, as a best practice, first stop any applications that are sending records before you delete a delivery stream.</p>"
firehose,DescribeDeliveryStream,"<p>Describes the specified delivery stream and its status. For example, after your delivery stream is created, call <code>DescribeDeliveryStream</code> to see whether the delivery stream is <code>ACTIVE</code> and therefore ready for data to be sent to it. </p> <p>If the status of a delivery stream is <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, this status doesn't change, and you can't invoke <a>CreateDeliveryStream</a> again on it. However, you can invoke the <a>DeleteDeliveryStream</a> operation to delete it. If the status is <code>DELETING_FAILED</code>, you can force deletion by invoking <a>DeleteDeliveryStream</a> again but with <a>DeleteDeliveryStreamInput$AllowForceDelete</a> set to true.</p>"
firehose,ListDeliveryStreams,"<p>Lists your delivery streams in alphabetical order of their names.</p> <p>The number of delivery streams might be too large to return using a single call to <code>ListDeliveryStreams</code>. You can limit the number of delivery streams returned, using the <code>Limit</code> parameter. To determine whether there are more delivery streams to list, check the value of <code>HasMoreDeliveryStreams</code> in the output. If there are more delivery streams to list, you can request them by calling this operation again and setting the <code>ExclusiveStartDeliveryStreamName</code> parameter to the name of the last delivery stream returned in the last call.</p>"
firehose,ListTagsForDeliveryStream,<p>Lists the tags for the specified delivery stream. This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per account. </p>
firehose,PutRecord,"<p>Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream. To write multiple data records into a delivery stream, use <a>PutRecordBatch</a>. Applications using these operations are referred to as producers.</p> <p>By default, each delivery stream can take in up to 2,000 transactions per second, 5,000 records per second, or 5 MB per second. If you use <a>PutRecord</a> and <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, the limits are an aggregate across these two operations for each delivery stream. For more information about limits and how to request an increase, see <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html"">Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Limits</a>. </p> <p>You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when using <a>PutRecord</a>. The data record consists of a data blob that can be up to 1 000 KiB in size  and any kind of data. For example  it can be a segment from a log file  geographic location data  website clickstream data  and so on.</p> <p>Kinesis Data Firehose buffers records before delivering them to the destination. To disambiguate the data blobs at the destination  a common solution is to use delimiters in the data  such as a newline (<code>\n</code>) or some other character unique within the data. This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the data from the destination.</p> <p>The <code>PutRecord</code> operation returns a <code>RecordId</code>  which is a unique string assigned to each record. Producer applications can use this ID for purposes such as auditability and investigation.</p> <p>If the <code>PutRecord</code> operation throws a <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code>  back off and retry. If the exception persists  it is possible that the throughput limits have been exceeded for the delivery stream. </p> <p>Data records sent to Kinesis Data Firehose are stored for 24 hours from the time they are added to a delivery stream as it tries to send the records to the destination. If the destination is unreachable for more than 24 hours  the data is no longer available.</p> <important> <p>Don't concatenate two or more base64 strings to form the data fields of your records. Instead  concatenate the raw data  then perform base64 encoding.</p> </important>"""
firehose,PutRecordBatch,"<p>Writes multiple data records into a delivery stream in a single call, which can achieve higher throughput per producer than when writing single records. To write single data records into a delivery stream, use <a>PutRecord</a>. Applications using these operations are referred to as producers.</p> <p>For information about service quota, see <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/limits.html"">Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Quota</a>.</p> <p>Each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request supports up to 500 records. Each record in the request can be as large as 1 000 KB (before base64 encoding)  up to a limit of 4 MB for the entire request. These limits cannot be changed.</p> <p>You must specify the name of the delivery stream and the data record when using <a>PutRecord</a>.

This allows the consumer application to parse individual data items when reading the data from the destination.</p> <p>The <a>PutRecordBatch</a> response includes a count of failed records  <code>FailedPutCount</code>  and an array of responses  <code>RequestResponses</code>. Even if the <a>PutRecordBatch</a> call succeeds  the value of <code>FailedPutCount</code> may be greater than 0  indicating that there are records for which the operation didn't succeed. Each entry in the <code>RequestResponses</code> array provides additional information about the processed record. It directly correlates with a record in the request array using the same ordering  from the top to the bottom. The response array always includes the same number of records as the request array. <code>RequestResponses</code> includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Firehose tries to process all records in each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records. </p> <p>A successfully processed record includes a <code>RecordId</code> value  which is unique for the record. An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code> and <code>ErrorMessage</code> values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error  and is one of the following values: <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code> or <code>InternalFailure</code>. <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed information about the error.</p> <p>If there is an internal server error or a timeout  the write might have completed or it might have failed. If <code>FailedPutCount</code> is greater than 0  retry the request  resending only those records that might have failed processing. This minimizes the possible duplicate records and also reduces the total bytes sent (and corresponding charges). We recommend that you handle any duplicates at the destination.</p> <p>If <a>PutRecordBatch</a> throws <code>ServiceUnavailableException</code>  back off and retry.

firehose,StartDeliveryStreamEncryption,"<p>Enables server-side encryption (SSE) for the delivery stream. </p> <p>This operation is asynchronous. It returns immediately. When you invoke it, Kinesis Data Firehose first sets the encryption status of the stream to <code>ENABLING</code>, and then to <code>ENABLED</code>. The encryption status of a delivery stream is the <code>Status</code> property in <a>DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfiguration</a>. If the operation fails, the encryption status changes to <code>ENABLING_FAILED</code>. You can continue to read and write data to your delivery stream while the encryption status is <code>ENABLING</code>, but the data is not encrypted. It can take up to 5 seconds after the encryption status changes to <code>ENABLED</code> before all records written to the delivery stream are encrypted. To find out whether a record or a batch of records was encrypted, check the response elements <a>PutRecordOutput$Encrypted</a> and <a>PutRecordBatchOutput$Encrypted</a>, respectively.</p> <p>To check the encryption status of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>.</p> <p>Even if encryption is currently enabled for a delivery stream, you can still invoke this operation on it to change the ARN of the CMK or both its type and ARN. If you invoke this method to change the CMK, and the old CMK is of type <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK</code>, Kinesis Data Firehose schedules the grant it had on the old CMK for retirement. If the new CMK is of type <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK</code>, Kinesis Data Firehose creates a grant that enables it to use the new CMK to encrypt and decrypt data and to manage the grant.</p> <p>If a delivery stream already has encryption enabled and then you invoke this operation to change the ARN of the CMK or both its type and ARN and you get <code>ENABLING_FAILED</code>, this only means that the attempt to change the CMK failed. In this case, encryption remains enabled with the old CMK.</p> <p>If the encryption status of your delivery stream is <code>ENABLING_FAILED</code>, you can invoke this operation again with a valid CMK. The CMK must be enabled and the key policy mustn't explicitly deny the permission for Kinesis Data Firehose to invoke KMS encrypt and decrypt operations.</p> <p>You can enable SSE for a delivery stream only if it's a delivery stream that uses <code>DirectPut</code> as its source. </p> <p>The <code>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</code> and <code>StopDeliveryStreamEncryption</code> operations have a combined limit of 25 calls per delivery stream per 24 hours. For example, you reach the limit if you call <code>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</code> 13 times and <code>StopDeliveryStreamEncryption</code> 12 times for the same delivery stream in a 24-hour period.</p>"
firehose,StopDeliveryStreamEncryption,"<p>Disables server-side encryption (SSE) for the delivery stream. </p> <p>This operation is asynchronous. It returns immediately.

gamelift,CreateAlias,"<p>Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. An alias provides a level of abstraction for a fleet that is useful when redirecting player traffic from one fleet to another, such as when updating your game build. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site. </p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description.

gamelift,PutScalingPolicy,"<p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p> <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.</p> <p>You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.</p> <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html"">Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>.</p> <p> <b>Target-based policy</b> </p> <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy  you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. </p> <p>For example  you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. </p> <p>To create or update a target-based policy  specify a fleet ID and name  and set the policy type to ""TargetBased"". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request  the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended  the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Rule-based policy</b> </p> <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric  sets a threshold value  and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy  you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much)  so you need one policy for each type of action. </p> <p>For example  a policy may make the following statement: ""If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes  then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%.""</p> <p>A policy's rule statement has the following structure:</p> <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes  then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p> <p>To implement the example  the rule statement would look like this:</p> <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes  then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p> <p>To create or update a scaling policy  specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID  and set the policy type to ""RuleBased"". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request  the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended  the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Related actions</b> </p> <p> <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a>"" <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> <a>DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a> <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> <a>DescribeScalingPolicies</a> <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a> <a>StopFleetActions</a> <a>StartFleetActions</a> <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-awssdk.html#reference-awssdk-resources-fleets"">All APIs by task</a> </p>"""

You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed  or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record to process.</p> <p>Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size  and each shard can read up to 2 MiB per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or throughput by using the <code>Limit</code> parameter to specify the maximum number of records that <a>GetRecords</a> can return. Consider your average record size when determining this limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per call is 10 000.</p> <p>The size of the data returned by <a>GetRecords</a> varies depending on the utilization of the shard. The maximum size of data that <a>GetRecords</a> can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data  subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream  subsequent calls made within the next 1 second throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. <a>GetRecords</a> doesn't return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason  we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. However  it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second.</p> <p>To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing  you can use the <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute. You can also monitor the stream using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html"">Monitoring</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).</p> <p>Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value  <code>ApproximateArrivalTimestamp</code>  that is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side time stamp  whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream  for example with <a>PutRecords</a>). The time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy  or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example  records in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of order.</p> <p>This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per shard.</p>"""
kinesis,GetShardIterator,"<p>Gets an Amazon Kinesis shard iterator. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester.</p> <p>A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. The position is specified using the sequence number of a data record in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record ingested in the stream, and is assigned when a record is put into the stream. Each stream has one or more shards.</p> <p>You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the <code>ShardIteratorType</code> parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number by using the <code>AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard iterator type. Alternatively, the parameter can read right after the sequence number by using the <code>AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls to <a>PutRecord</a>, <a>PutRecords</a>, <a>GetRecords</a>, or <a>DescribeStream</a>. In the request, you can specify the shard iterator type <code>AT_TIMESTAMP</code> to read records from an arbitrary point in time, <code>TRIM_HORIZON</code> to cause <code>ShardIterator</code> to point to the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system (the oldest data record in the shard), or <code>LATEST</code> so that you always read the most recent data in the shard. </p> <p>When you read repeatedly from a stream, use a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request to get the first shard iterator for use in your first <a>GetRecords</a> request and for subsequent reads use the shard iterator returned by the <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>. A new shard iterator is returned by every <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>, which you use in the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter of the next <a>GetRecords</a> request. </p> <p>If a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request is made too often, you receive a <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>.

KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted  even if they've lost track of the key ID. However  specifying the source KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the <code>SourceKeyId</code> parameter to specify a KMS key  KMS uses only the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key  the <code>ReEncrypt</code> operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.</p> </li> <li> <p>To reencrypt the data  you must use the <code>DestinationKeyId</code> parameter specify the KMS key that re-encrypts the data after it is decrypted. You can select a symmetric or asymmetric KMS key. If the destination KMS key is an asymmetric KMS key  you must also provide the encryption algorithm. The algorithm that you choose must be compatible with the KMS key.</p> <important> <p>When you use an asymmetric KMS key to encrypt or reencrypt data  be sure to record the KMS key and encryption algorithm that you choose. You will be required to provide the same KMS key and encryption algorithm when you decrypt the data. If the KMS key and algorithm do not match the values used to encrypt the data  the decrypt operation fails.</p> <p>You are not required to supply the key ID and encryption algorithm when you decrypt with symmetric KMS keys because KMS stores this information in the ciphertext blob.

kms,ReplicateKey,"<p>Replicates a multi-Region key into the specified Region. This operation creates a multi-Region replica key based on a multi-Region primary key in a different Region of the same Amazon Web Services partition. You can create multiple replicas of a primary key, but each must be in a different Region. To create a multi-Region primary key, use the <a>CreateKey</a> operation.</p> <p>This operation supports <i>multi-Region keys</i>, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html"">Using multi-Region keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>A <i>replica key</i> is a fully-functional KMS key that can be used independently of its primary and peer replica keys. A primary key and its replica keys share properties that make them interoperable.

KMS pricing and quotas for KMS keys apply to each primary key and replica key.</p> <p>When this operation completes  the new replica key has a transient key state of <code>Creating</code>. This key state changes to <code>Enabled</code> (or <code>PendingImport</code>) after a few seconds when the process of creating the new replica key is complete. While the key state is <code>Creating</code>  you can manage key  but you cannot yet use it in cryptographic operations.

When this operation is successful, the key state of the KMS key changes to <code>PendingDeletion</code> and the key can't be used in any cryptographic operations. It remains in this state for the duration of the waiting period. Before the waiting period ends, you can use <a>CancelKeyDeletion</a> to cancel the deletion of the KMS key. After the waiting period ends, KMS deletes the KMS key, its key material, and all KMS data associated with it, including all aliases that refer to it.</p> <important> <p>Deleting a KMS key is a destructive and potentially dangerous operation. When a KMS key is deleted, all data that was encrypted under the KMS key is unrecoverable. (The only exception is a multi-Region replica key.)

lambda,CreateFunction,"<p>Creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html"">deployment package</a> and an <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role"">execution role</a>. The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use Amazon Web Services services  such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and X-Ray for request tracing.</p> <p>You set the package type to <code>Image</code> if the deployment package is a <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html"">container image</a>. For a container image  the code property must include the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry. You do not need to specify the handler and runtime properties. </p> <p>You set the package type to <code>Zip</code> if the deployment package is a <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html#gettingstarted-package-zip"">.zip file archive</a>. For a .zip file archive  the code property specifies the location of the .zip file. You must also specify the handler and runtime properties. The code in the deployment package must be compatible with the target instruction set architecture of the function (<code>x86-64</code> or <code>arm64</code>). If you do not specify the architecture  the default value is <code>x86-64</code>.</p> <p>When you create a function  Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC  this process can take a minute or so. During this time  you can't invoke or modify the function. The <code>State</code>  <code>StateReason</code>  and <code>StateReasonCode</code> fields in the response from <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the function is ready to invoke. For more information  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html"">Function States</a>.</p> <p>A function has an unpublished version  and can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration. A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version  and can be changed to map to a different version. Use the <code>Publish</code> parameter to create version <code>1</code> of your function from its initial configuration.</p> <p>The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify version-specific settings later with <a>UpdateFunctionConfiguration</a>. Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the function  and include tags (<a>TagResource</a>) and per-function concurrency limits (<a>PutFunctionConcurrency</a>).</p> <p>You can use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable code signing for this function  specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code package with <a>UpdateFunctionCode</a>  Lambda checks that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configuration includes set set of signing profiles  which define the trusted publishers for this function.</p> <p>If another account or an Amazon Web Services service invokes your function  use <a>AddPermission</a> to grant permission by creating a resource-based IAM policy. You can grant permissions at the function level  on a version  or on an alias.</p> <p>To invoke your function directly  use <a>Invoke</a>. To invoke your function in response to events in other Amazon Web Services services  create an event source mapping (<a>CreateEventSourceMapping</a>)  or configure a function trigger in the other service.

You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of disks, and to save data before shutting down a Lightsail instance.</p> <p>You can take a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your disk at the time the snapshot command is issued. This may exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the disk long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file writes to the disk, you should unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance, issue the create disk snapshot command, and then remount the disk to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while the snapshot status is pending.</p> <p>You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of an instance's system volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data from the system volume of a botched instance or to create a backup of the system volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a system volume, just define the <code>instance name</code> parameter when issuing the snapshot command, and a snapshot of the defined instance's system volume will be created. After the snapshot is available, you can create a block storage disk from the snapshot and attach it to a running instance to access the data on the disk.</p> <p>The <code>create disk snapshot</code> operation supports tag-based access control via request tags.

You can create a namespace after your Amazon Web Services account is subscribed to Amazon QuickSight. The namespace must be unique within the Amazon Web Services account. By default, there is a limit of 100 namespaces per Amazon Web Services account. To increase your limit, create a ticket with Amazon Web Services Support. </p>"
quicksight,CreateTemplate,<p>Creates a template from an existing Amazon QuickSight analysis or template. You can use the resulting template to create a dashboard.</p> <p>A <i>template</i> is an entity in Amazon QuickSight that encapsulates the metadata required to create an analysis and that you can use to create s dashboard. A template adds a layer of abstraction by using placeholders to replace the dataset associated with the analysis. You can use templates to create dashboards by replacing dataset placeholders with datasets that follow the same schema that was used to create the source analysis and template.</p>
quicksight,CreateTemplateAlias,<p>Creates a template alias for a template.</p>

quicksight,DeleteAccountCustomization,<p>Deletes all Amazon QuickSight customizations in this Amazon Web Services Region for the specified Amazon Web Services account and Amazon QuickSight namespace.</p>
quicksight,DeleteAnalysis,"<p>Deletes an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include a recovery window during which you can restore the analysis. If you don't specify a recovery window value, the operation defaults to 30 days. Amazon QuickSight attaches a <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp to the response that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recovery window, Amazon QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently.</p> <p>At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the <code>RestoreAnalysis</code> API operation to remove the <code>DeletionTime</code> stamp and cancel the deletion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible in the API until it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from it.</p> <p>An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the Amazon QuickSight console. To access it in the console, restore it. Deleting an analysis doesn't delete the dashboards that you publish from it.</p>"

quicksight,DescribeAccountCustomization,"<p>Describes the customizations associated with the provided Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Amazon QuickSight namespace in an Amazon Web Services Region. The Amazon QuickSight console evaluates which customizations to apply by running this API operation with the <code>Resolved</code> flag included. </p> <p>To determine what customizations display when you run this command, it can help to visualize the relationship of the entities involved. </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Amazon Web Services account</code> - The Amazon Web Services account exists at the top of the hierarchy. It has the potential to use all of the Amazon Web Services Regions and AWS Services. When you subscribe to Amazon QuickSight, you choose one Amazon Web Services Region to use as your home Region. That's where your free SPICE capacity is located. You can use Amazon QuickSight in any supported Amazon Web Services Region. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Amazon Web Services Region</code> - In each Amazon Web Services Region where you sign in to Amazon QuickSight at least once, Amazon QuickSight acts as a separate instance of the same service. If you have a user directory, it resides in us-east-1, which is the US East (N. Virginia). Generally speaking, these users have access to Amazon QuickSight in any Amazon Web Services Region, unless they are constrained to a namespace. </p> <p>To run the command in a different Amazon Web Services Region, you change your Region settings. If you're using the AWS CLI, you can use one of the following options:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-options.html"">command line options</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p>Use <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html"">named profiles</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p>Run <code>aws configure</code> to change your default Amazon Web Services Region. Use Enter to key the same settings for your keys. For more information  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html"">Configuring the AWS CLI</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <code>Namespace</code> - A Amazon QuickSight namespace is a partition that contains users and assets (data sources  datasets  dashboards  and so on). To access assets that are in a specific namespace  users and groups must also be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in other namespaces  even if they are in the same Amazon Web Services account and Amazon Web Services Region.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Applied customizations</code> - Within an Amazon Web Services Region  a set of Amazon QuickSight customizations can apply to an Amazon Web Services account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an Amazon Web Services account. All settings are isolated to a single Amazon Web Services Region. To apply them in other Amazon Web Services Regions  run the <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> command in each Amazon Web Services Region where you want to apply the same customizations. </p> </li> </ul>"""

rekognition,CompareFaces,"<p>Compares a face in the <i>source</i> input image with each of the 100 largest faces detected in the <i>target</i> input image. </p> <p> If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face and compares it with each face detected in the target image. </p> <note> <p>CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic. A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use <code>CompareFaces</code> to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further validation before taking action.</p> </note> <p>You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. </p> <p>In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face, facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face). The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. </p> <note> <p>By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter.</p> </note> <p> <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image. For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality. The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box of the face and confidence value.</p> <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces that don’t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a variety of common use cases. Use <code>QualityFilter</code> to set the quality bar by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>. If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. The default value is <code>NONE</code>. </p> <p>If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns orientation information for the source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.</p> <p>If no faces are detected in the source or target images, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns an <code>InvalidParameterException</code> error. </p> <note> <p> This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.</p> </note> <p>For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CompareFaces</code> action.</p>"

If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <p> For each object that the model version detects on an image, the API returns a (<code>CustomLabel</code>) object in an array (<code>CustomLabels</code>). Each <code>CustomLabel</code> object provides the label name (<code>Name</code>), the level of confidence that the image contains the object (<code>Confidence</code>), and object location information, if it exists, for the label on the image (<code>Geometry</code>). </p> <p>To filter labels that are returned, specify a value for <code>MinConfidence</code>. <code>DetectCustomLabelsLabels</code> only returns labels with a confidence that's higher than the specified value. The value of <code>MinConfidence</code> maps to the assumed threshold values created during training. For more information, see <i>Assumed threshold</i> in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels metrics expresses an assumed threshold as a floating point value between 0-1. The range of <code>MinConfidence</code> normalizes the threshold value to a percentage value (0-100). Confidence responses from <code>DetectCustomLabels</code> are also returned as a percentage. You can use <code>MinConfidence</code> to change the precision and recall or your model. For more information, see <i>Analyzing an image</i> in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. </p> <p>If you don't specify a value for <code>MinConfidence</code>, <code>DetectCustomLabels</code> returns labels based on the assumed threshold of each label.</p> <p>This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:DetectCustomLabels</code> action. </p> <p>For more information, see <i>Analyzing an image</i> in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide. </p>"
rekognition,DetectFaces,"<p>Detects faces within an image that is provided as input.</p> <p> <code>DetectFaces</code> detects the 100 largest faces in the image. For each face detected, the operation returns face details. These details include a bounding box of the face, a confidence value (that the bounding box contains a face), and a fixed set of attributes such as facial landmarks (for example, coordinates of eye and mouth), presence of beard, sunglasses, and so on. </p> <p>The face-detection algorithm is most effective on frontal faces. For non-frontal or obscured faces, the algorithm might not detect the faces or might detect faces with lower confidence. </p> <p>You pass the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <note> <p>This is a stateless API operation. That is, the operation does not persist any data.</p> </note> <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:DetectFaces</code> action. </p>"
rekognition,DetectLabels,"<p>Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as input. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; and concepts like landscape, evening, and nature. </p> <p>For an example, see Analyzing Images Stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p> <note> <p> <code>DetectLabels</code> does not support the detection of activities. However, activity detection is supported for label detection in videos. For more information, see StartLabelDetection in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p> </note> <p>You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file. </p> <p> For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. Each label provides the object name, and the level of confidence that the image contains the object. For example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea, and a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object. </p> <p> <code>{Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}</code> </p> <p> <code> {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}</code> </p> <p>In the preceding example, the operation returns one label for each of the three objects. The operation can also return multiple labels for the same object in the image. For example, if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the operation might return the following three labels. </p> <p> <code>{Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p> <code>{Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}</code> </p> <p>In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies the flower as a tulip.</p> <p>In response, the API returns an array of labels. In addition, the response also includes the orientation correction. Optionally, you can specify <code>MinConfidence</code> to control the confidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the <code>MaxLabels</code> parameter to limit the number of labels returned. </p> <note> <p>If the object detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide the same facial details that the <a>DetectFaces</a> operation provides.</p> </note> <p> <code>DetectLabels</code> returns bounding boxes for instances of common object labels in an array of <a>Instance</a> objects. An <code>Instance</code> object contains a <a>BoundingBox</a> object, for the location of the label on the image. It also includes the confidence by which the bounding box was detected.</p> <p> <code>DetectLabels</code> also returns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label <i>car</i>. The label <i>car</i> has two parent labels: <i>Vehicle</i> (its parent) and <i>Transportation</i> (its grandparent). The response returns the entire list of ancestors for a label. Each ancestor is a unique label in the response. In the previous example, <i>Car</i>, <i>Vehicle</i>, and <i>Transportation</i> are returned as unique labels in the response. </p> <p>This is a stateless API operation.

route53,ChangeResourceRecordSets,"<p>Creates, changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains authoritative DNS information for a specified domain name or subdomain name. For example, you can use <code>ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> to create a resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.</p> <p> <b>Deleting Resource Record Sets</b> </p> <p>To delete a resource record set, you must specify all the same values that you specified when you created it.</p> <p> <b>Change Batches and Transactional Changes</b> </p> <p>The request body must include a document with a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. </p> <p>For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes the <code>CNAME</code> resource record set for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. If validation for both records succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation.

Additionally  you must have <i>read</i> access to the source object and <i>write</i> access to the destination bucket. For more information  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html"">REST Authentication</a>. Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.</p> <p>A copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts  you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation  the error response is embedded in the <code>200 OK</code> response. This means that a <code>200 OK</code> response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.</p> <p>If the copy is successful  you receive a response with information about the copied object.</p> <note> <p>If the request is an HTTP 1.1 request  the response is chunk encoded. If it were not  it would not contain the content-length  and you would need to read the entire body.</p> </note> <p>The copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information  see <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/"">Amazon S3 pricing</a>.</p> <important> <p>Amazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint  you get a 400 <code>Bad Request</code> error. For more information  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html"">Transfer Acceleration</a>.</p> </important> <p> <b>Metadata</b> </p> <p>When copying an object  you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However  the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting  specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html"">Using ACLs</a>. </p> <p>To specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request  you can optionally add the <code>x-amz-metadata-directive</code> header. When you grant permissions  you can use the <code>s3:x-amz-metadata-directive</code> condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded.

If the current version is a delete marker  Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version  use the <code>versionId</code> subresource.</p> <p>If you enable versioning on the target bucket  Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the <code>x-amz-version-id</code> response header in the response.</p> <p>If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket  the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.</p> <p>If the source object's storage class is GLACIER  you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation.

s3,CreateBucket,"<p>Creates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.</p> <p>Not every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket naming restrictions, see <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html"">Bucket naming rules</a>.</p> <p>If you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_control_CreateBucket.html"">Create Bucket</a>. </p> <p>By default  the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency  minimize costs  or address regulatory requirements. For example  if you reside in Europe  you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro"">Accessing a bucket</a>.</p> <note> <p>If you send your create bucket request to the <code>s3.amazonaws.com</code> endpoint  the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly  the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region  even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia)  your application must be able to handle 307 redirect.

You can, however, create a logical hierarchy by using object key names that imply a folder structure. For example, instead of naming an object <code>sample.jpg</code>, you can name it <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>.</p> <p>To get an object from such a logical hierarchy, specify the full key name for the object in the <code>GET</code> operation. For a virtual hosted-style request example, if you have the object <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>, specify the resource as <code>/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>. For a path-style request example, if you have the object <code>photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code> in the bucket named <code>examplebucket</code>, specify the resource as <code>/examplebucket/photos/2006/February/sample.jpg</code>.

You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.</p> <p>Amazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.</p> <p>Amazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead.</p> <p>To ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the <code>Content-MD5</code> header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>To successfully complete the <code>PutObject</code> request, you must have the <code>s3:PutObject</code> in your IAM permissions.</p> </li> <li> <p>To successfully change the objects acl of your <code>PutObject</code> request, you must have the <code>s3:PutObjectAcl</code> in your IAM permissions.</p> </li> <li> <p> The <code>Content-MD5</code> header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock.

With server-side encryption  Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html"">Using Server-Side Encryption</a>.</p> <p>If you request server-side encryption using Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)  you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level.

By default  all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object  you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object.

For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.</p> <p>To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p> <p>When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b> <code>Expedited</code> </b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Standard</code> </b> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Bulk</code> </b> - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data access, see <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html"">Restoring Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> <p>You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress.

Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header  which provides information about the restoration status  in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html"">Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>After restoring an archived object  you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.</p> <p>If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action  the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example  if you restore an object copy for 10 days  but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days  Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days.

The response might include some stale data. If the dependent entities are not yet in DynamoDB  this causes a validation error. If you repeat your read request after a short time  the response should return the latest data. So retry logic is recommended to handle these possible issues. We also recommend that customers call <a>DescribeEndpointConfig</a> before calling <a>CreateEndpoint</a> to minimize the potential impact of a DynamoDB eventually consistent read.</p> </note> <p>When Amazon SageMaker receives the request  it sets the endpoint status to <code>Creating</code>.

sagemaker,CreateEndpointConfig,"<p>Creates an endpoint configuration that Amazon SageMaker hosting services uses to deploy models. In the configuration, you identify one or more models, created using the <code>CreateModel</code> API, to deploy and the resources that you want Amazon SageMaker to provision. Then you call the <a>CreateEndpoint</a> API.</p> <note> <p> Use this API if you want to use Amazon SageMaker hosting services to deploy models into production. </p> </note> <p>In the request, you define a <code>ProductionVariant</code>, for each model that you want to deploy. Each <code>ProductionVariant</code> parameter also describes the resources that you want Amazon SageMaker to provision. This includes the number and type of ML compute instances to deploy. </p> <p>If you are hosting multiple models, you also assign a <code>VariantWeight</code> to specify how much traffic you want to allocate to each model. For example, suppose that you want to host two models, A and B, and you assign traffic weight 2 for model A and 1 for model B. Amazon SageMaker distributes two-thirds of the traffic to Model A, and one-third to model B. </p> <note> <p>When you call <a>CreateEndpoint</a>, a load call is made to DynamoDB to verify that your endpoint configuration exists. When you read data from a DynamoDB table supporting <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html""> <code>Eventually Consistent Reads</code> </a>  the response might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The response might include some stale data. If the dependent entities are not yet in DynamoDB  this causes a validation error. If you repeat your read request after a short time  the response should return the latest data. So retry logic is recommended to handle these possible issues. We also recommend that customers call <a>DescribeEndpointConfig</a> before calling <a>CreateEndpoint</a> to minimize the potential impact of a DynamoDB eventually consistent read.</p> </note>"""

After the rotation completes, the protected service and its clients all use the new version of the secret. </p> <p>This required configuration information includes the ARN of an Amazon Web Services Lambda function and optionally, the time between scheduled rotations. The Lambda rotation function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the credentials on the protected service to match. After testing the new credentials, the function marks the new secret with the staging label <code>AWSCURRENT</code> so that your clients all immediately begin to use the new version.

ses,SendRawEmail,"<p>Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending.</p> <p>This operation is more flexible than the <code>SendEmail</code> API operation. When you use the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, you can specify the headers of the message as well as its content. This flexibility is useful, for example, when you want to send a multipart MIME email (such a message that contains both a text and an HTML version). You can also use this operation to send messages that include attachments.</p> <p>The <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation has the following requirements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You can only send email from <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html"">verified email addresses or domains</a>.

sqs,TagQueue,
ssm,AddTagsToResource,"<p>Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents, managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. For example:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Key=Owner,Value=DbAdmin</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Owner,Value=SysAdmin</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Owner,Value=Dev</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Production</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Pre-Production</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Key=Stack,Value=Test</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags.</p> <p>We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add.

For dynamic targets, such as an Amazon Web Services resource group or an Amazon Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the configuration when new instances are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software isn't installed, then State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service isn't running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service. </p>"

sts,AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity,"<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been authenticated in a mobile or web application with a web identity provider. Example providers include Amazon Cognito, Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.</p> <note> <p>For mobile applications, we recommend that you use Amazon Cognito. You can use Amazon Cognito with the <a href=http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/"">Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href=""http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/"">Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application.</p> <p>To learn more about Amazon Cognito  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840"">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in <i>Amazon Web Services SDK for Android Developer Guide</i> and <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664"">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services SDK for iOS Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of Amazon Web Services security credentials. Therefore  you can distribute an application (for example  on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term Amazon Web Services credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term Amazon Web Services credentials. Instead  the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html"">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison"">Comparing the STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID  a secret access key  and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to Amazon Web Services service API operations.</p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default  the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However  you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours.

sts,DecodeAuthorizationMessage,"<p>Decodes additional information about the authorization status of a request from an encoded message returned in response to an Amazon Web Services request.</p> <p>For example, if a user is not authorized to perform an operation that he or she has requested, the request returns a <code>Client.UnauthorizedOperation</code> response (an HTTP 403 response). Some Amazon Web Services operations additionally return an encoded message that can provide details about this authorization failure. </p> <note> <p>Only certain Amazon Web Services operations return an encoded authorization message. The documentation for an individual operation indicates whether that operation returns an encoded message in addition to returning an HTTP code.</p> </note> <p>The message is encoded because the details of the authorization status can constitute privileged information that the user who requested the operation should not see. To decode an authorization status message, a user must be granted permissions via an IAM policy to request the <code>DecodeAuthorizationMessage</code> (<code>sts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage</code>) action. </p> <p>The decoded message includes the following type of information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Whether the request was denied due to an explicit deny or due to the absence of an explicit allow.

Access key IDs beginning with <code>AKIA</code> are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the Amazon Web Services account root user. Access key IDs beginning with <code>ASIA</code> are temporary credentials that are created using STS operations. If the account in the response belongs to you  you can sign in as the root user and review your root user access keys. Then  you can pull a <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html"">credentials report</a> to learn which IAM user owns the keys.

sts,GetCallerIdentity,"<p>Returns details about the IAM user or role whose credentials are used to call the operation.</p> <note> <p>No permissions are required to perform this operation. If an administrator adds a policy to your IAM user or role that explicitly denies access to the <code>sts:GetCallerIdentity</code> action, you can still perform this operation.

sts,GetFederationToken,"<p>Returns a set of temporary security credentials (consisting of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token) for a federated user. A typical use is in a proxy application that gets temporary security credentials on behalf of distributed applications inside a corporate network. You must call the <code>GetFederationToken</code> operation using the long-term security credentials of an IAM user.

wafv2,CheckCapacity,"<p>Returns the web ACL capacity unit (WCU) requirements for a specified scope and set of rules. You can use this to check the capacity requirements for the rules you want to use in a <a>RuleGroup</a> or <a>WebACL</a>. </p> <p>WAF uses WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to reflect the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to run use fewer WCUs than more complex rules that use more processing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at creation, which helps users plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500. </p>"

In the web ACL, you assign a default action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types <a>Rule</a>, <a>RuleGroup</a>, and managed rule group. You can associate a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The resources can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AppSync GraphQL API. </p>"

A segment document can be a completed segment  an in-progress segment  or an array of subsegments.</p> <p>Segments must include the following fields. For the full segment document schema  see <a href=""https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html"">Amazon Web Services X-Ray Segment Documents</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services X-Ray Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p class=""title""> <b>Required segment document fields</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>name</code> - The name of the service that handled the request.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>id</code> - A 64-bit identifier for the segment  unique among segments in the same trace  in 16 hexadecimal digits.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>trace_id</code> - A unique identifier that connects all segments and subsegments originating from a single client request.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>start_time</code> - Time the segment or subsegment was created  in floating point seconds in epoch time  accurate to milliseconds. For example  <code>1480615200.010</code> or <code>1.480615200010E9</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>end_time</code> - Time the segment or subsegment was closed. For example  <code>1480615200.090</code> or <code>1.480615200090E9</code>. Specify either an <code>end_time</code> or <code>in_progress</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>in_progress</code> - Set to <code>true</code> instead of specifying an <code>end_time</code> to record that a segment has been started  but is not complete. Send an in-progress segment when your application receives a request that will take a long time to serve  to trace that the request was received. When the response is sent  send the complete segment to overwrite the in-progress segment.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A <code>trace_id</code> consists of three numbers separated by hyphens. For example  1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979. This includes:</p> <p class=""title""> <b>Trace ID Format</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p>The version number  for instance  <code>1</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The time of the original request  in Unix epoch time  in 8 hexadecimal digits. For example  10:00AM December 2nd  2016 PST in epoch time is <code>1480615200</code> seconds  or <code>58406520</code> in hexadecimal.</p> </li> <li> <p>A 96-bit identifier for the trace  globally unique  in 24 hexadecimal digits.</p> </li> </ul>"""
